	<p>Dr. Zikmund-Fisher uses his interdisciplinary background in decision psychology and behavioral economics to study factors that affect individual decision-making about a variety of health and medical issues. His research in health communications has involved the use of iterative experiments to develop and test methods for making risk statistics and other types of quantitative health information meaningful and useful for decision making by patients and the public. He has also researched the measurement of individual numeracy (people's ability to interpret quantitative health information) and the effects of low numeracy on people’s ability to understand risk. Other past research projects have included the <%=link_to 'National Survey of Medical Decisions (the DECISIONS study)', 'http://mdm.sagepub.com/content/30/5_suppl', {:target => '_blank'} %> and the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)-funded <%=link_to 'Community Perceptions of Dioxins (CPOD)', 'http://www.sph.umich.edu/CPOD/', {:target => '_blank'} %> Study that has used a mental models approach to examine how community residents are or are not able to interpret quantitative exposure information provided as part of exposure assessment studies. He also serves as an Associate Editor for the journal <%=link_to 'Medical Decision Making', 'http://mdm.sagepub.com/', {:target => '_blank'} %>.</p>
