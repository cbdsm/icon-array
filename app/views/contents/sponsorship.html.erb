	<p>The development and hosting of <em>Iconarray.com</em> has been sponsored by the <%=link_to 'University of Michigan Risk Science Center', 'http://www.sph.umich.edu/riskcenter/', {:target => '_blank'} %> and the <%=link_to 'UM Center for Bioethics and Social Sciences in Medicine (CBSSM)', 'http://www.cbssm.org', {:target => '_blank'}%>.</p>

	<p>The <%=link_to 'UM Risk Science Center (UMRSC)', 'http://www.sph.umich.edu/riskcenter/', {:target => '_blank'} %> is an interdisciplinary research center based in the <%=link_to 'UM School of Public Health', 'http://www.sph.umich.edu/', {:target => '_blank'} %> dedicated to supporting science-informed decision-making on existing and emerging human health risks. Drawing on expertise spanning public health, risk assessment, medicine, business, engineering, public policy, social research, economics and communication, the Center brings a unique and integrative approach to the increasingly complex challenges of addressing health risks associated with technological, social and economic change. The UMRSC’s Director (<%=link_to 'Dr. Andrew Maynard', 'http://www.sph.umich.edu/iscr/faculty/profile.cfm?uniqname=maynarda', {:target => '_blank'} %>) is the only endowed chair in Risk Science in the US. Dr. Zikmund-Fisher directs the UMRSC-funded Risk Communication Focus Initiative and draws upon its researchers’ experience in communicating complex data about health risks to the public.</p>

	<p>The <%=link_to 'UM Center for Bioethics and Social Sciences in Medicine (CBSSM)', 'http://www.cbssm.org', {:target => '_blank'}%> is a joint program through the <%=link_to 'University of Michigan School of Medicine', 'http://www.med.umich.edu/medschool/', {:target => '_blank'} %> and the <%=link_to 'Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Center for Clinical Management Research', 'http://www.annarbor.va.gov/', {:target => '_blank'} %> that is part of the new <%=link_to 'UM Institute for Health Policy and Innovation (IHPI)', 'http://ncrc.umich.edu/research/initiatives/ihpi', {:target => '_blank'} %>. Members of the center (numbering approximately 30 faculty) include physicians with varying clinical specialties (i.e., general internists, neurology, radiation oncology, gastroenterology, psychiatry), decision scientists, public health experts, and bioethicists. CBSSM acts as a research “home” for anyone interested in applying empirical social science methods to improve medical care and thus truly embodies the concept of an interdisciplinary environment that is more than the sum of its parts.  Dr. Zikmund-Fisher directs the CBSSM Internet Survey Lab, which has conducted dozens of experimental tests of risk communication methods, patient decision support materials, and  web-based methods.</p>
