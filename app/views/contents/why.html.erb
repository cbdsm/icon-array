	<h3>Why Use Icon Arrays</h3>
	<p>Icon Arrays combine some of the best elements of alternate communication formats such as tables or bar charts. A icon array is made up of unique elements representing individual units (people) within the at risk population. As a result, it accurately communicates exact percentages the way a table does. However, icon arrays also convey "gist" impressions derived from the relative proportion of colored vs. uncolored area in the graph. As such, they are similar in effectiveness to bar graphs and other area or height-based graphics. Furthermore, icon arrays are like pie charts in that they represent the entire risk denominator visually, unlike bar charts which focus attention primarily on the risk numerator. </p>
	<p>CBSSM researchers <a href="http://www.cbssm.org/people/6">Angie Fagerlin</a>, <a href="http://www.cbssm.org/people/19">Brian Zikmund-Fisher</a>, and <a href="http://www.cbssm.org/people/17">Peter Ubel</a>, have shown that using icon arrays in risk communication contexts can be used to effectively communicate the incremental benefit of risk reducing treatments (<a href="http://www.cbssm.org/publications/882">Zikmund-Fisher, 2008</a>) and the risk of developing side effects from medications, especially when multiple colors are used to distinguish the incremental risk caused by treatment (<a href="http://www.cbssm.org/publications/559">Zikmund-Fisher, 2008)</a>). Icon Arrays can also limit the biases induced by the presence of powerful anecdotal narratives of former patients&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.cbssm.org/publications/161">Fagerlin, 2005</a>) and incremental risk formats (<a href="http://www.cbssm.org/publications/877">Zikmund-Fisher, 2008</a>). In a study that directly compared graphical formats, icon arrays were also the only graphical format that supported acquisition of both verbatim and all-important "gist" knowledge (<a href="http://www.cbssm.org/publications/880">Hawley, 2008</a>). A sample incremental risk graphic from one of our studies is shown below.</p>

	<p>CBSSM researchers are not alone in our use of icon arrays. Other researchers have shown that image matrices of this type are easier to interpret quickly and accurately than other formats <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=17237451">(Feldman-Stewart, 2007)</a>, are sometimes preferred by patients <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=16950729">(Schapira, 2006)</a>, and may reduce side effect aversion in treatment decision making. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=17385998">(Waters, 2007)</a> </p>
